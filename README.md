# Job Portal Skeleton

This repository contains a basic static website and a simple Express.js backend to demonstrate a starting point for a job portal application for riders and drivers.

## Server Setup

The `server` directory includes a small API with endpoints to register job seekers and employers, create job posts, and list jobs.

### Run the server

```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

The server listens on port `3000` by default and stores data in memory.
